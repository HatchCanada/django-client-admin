Django Client Admin Documentation
========================================

Client Admin is an open source project developed by `Concentric Sky`_ that enhances Django Admin by providing organization tools and features that make the interface more appropriate for clients. Some of the code started as `Admin Tools`_, although the theming engine has been removed and many features have been added.
